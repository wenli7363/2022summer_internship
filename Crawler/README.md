# Crawler.md

This folder are some code about `web crawler`.

`create.py` --- crawl house information
`salary爬虫.py` --- crawl salary datas

I strongly suggest you not to use this part code because it is no perfect.

These two programs may fail because they are restricted by the anti crawler mechanism of the website

You can directly use the `HouseAndSalary` database in `Web` folder, which we have already prepared.
