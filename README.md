# 2022summer_internship👋

We have developed a big data analysis platform for house price and occupation， 

This Web shown housing information(e.g. house prince ) and IT industry salary datas for over 30 cities

So, just a simple project about Data Vistualization...

# What we have done?

1. We used `beatifulsoup, Requests, Scrapy` module in python to crawl datas from [职友集](https://www.jobui.com/),[安居客](www.anjuke.com)
2. We stored our data in `sqlite` database after some basic data processing operation.
3. We defined lots of function to search information in our database and then returned the datas we need (these are API)
4. We used `python+flask` to build up our web server. Used `echarts` to draw some statistical charts.

# My own comment

This was not so perfect, but it was my first web project.

~~Btw, this piece of 💩 got A grade in this internship ....😂~~
